            <div class="word">
                <p>In the vast, boundless expanse of the universe, there exists a tiny asteroid named B-612. It
                    floats serenely amidst
                    the sea of stars, so small that it could easily be overlooked. Yet, on this minuscule celestial
                    body resides a being
                    of great significance—the Little Prince.</p>
                <p>The Little Prince is a diminutive figure with locks of golden hair that shimmer in the cosmic
                    light. His asteroid,
                    though small, is his cherished home. It is inhabited by a single rose, a flower of unparalleled
                    beauty and
                    significance to him. Alongside the rose, there are three volcanoes, each no taller than his
                    knee. One of them is
                    extinct, but the Little Prince tends to them all with equal care, for they are part of his
                    world.</p>
                <p>Life on B-612 was simple and routine for the Little Prince. Each day, he would water his beloved
                    rose, meticulously
                    removing the baobab seedlings that threatened to overtake his tiny planet. These seedlings, if
                    left unchecked, would
                    grow and grow, their roots spreading and consuming everything in their path. But the Little
                    Prince was diligent,
                    ensuring that his planet remained a manageable and lovely home.</p>
                <p>One day, a thought struck the Little Prince like a bolt of starlight. He yearned to leave the
                    familiarity of B-612
                    and venture into the unknown, to explore the other worlds that dotted the cosmos. With aheart
                    full of curiosity and a spirit unbound, he set off on his interstellar journey.</p>
                <p>The Little Prince's first destination was a planet shaped like a grand hat. Upon it sat a king,
                    resplendent in a robe
                    of the finest fabric, perched upon a towering throne. The king proclaimed himself the ruler of
                    the universe, his
                    voice echoing with authority. The Little Prince, intrigued, approached the king and asked, "What
                    do you rule over?"
                </p>
                <p>The king gestured grandly at his domain. "Everything here is under my command," he declared. The
                    Little Prince looked
                    around, puzzled. Apart from the king himself, the planet was barren. The king, noticing the
                    Little Prince's
                    confusion, explained, "I need subjects to affirm my power. Your arrival makes you my subject."
                    The Little Prince was
                    baffled. He couldn't comprehend why the king required others to validate his authority,
                    especially when there was
                    nothing on the planet to truly rule over. With a polite bow, he bid the king farewell and
                    continued his odyssey.</p>
                <p>Next, the Little Prince arrived at a planet adorned with a magnificent garden. Here lived a
                    businessman, hunched over
                    a desk cluttered with papers and ledgers. The businessman was busily counting andcalculating,
                    his eyes never straying from his work. The Little Prince watched in wonder as the businessman
                    scribbled
                    furiously, muttering to himself about owning the stars.</p>
                <p>"What are you doing?" the Little Prince inquired.</p>
                <p>"I am counting my possessions," the businessman replied without looking up. "I own all the stars
                    in the sky. They are
                    my property."</p>
                <p>The Little Prince was astounded. "But why do you own the stars? They are so far away, and you
                    don't even look at
                    them."</p>
                <p>The businessman paused, annoyance flickering in his eyes. "I don't have time for such
                    foolishness. I am a serious man
                    of business. I own the stars, and that is all that matters."</p>
                <p>The Little Prince shook his head, unable to grasp the businessman's logic. He felt a deep sadness
                    for the man who
                    claimed ownership of the stars yet failed to appreciate their beauty. With a heavy heart, he
                    left the planet, the
                    businessman's words echoing in his mind.</p>
                <p>His journey led him to a planet inhabited by a geographer. The geographer was an old man with a
                    long beard and a pair
                    of round spectacles perched on his nose. He sat at a large desk, surrounded by maps and atlases.
                    The Little Prince,
                    always eager to learn, approached the geographer and asked about the other planets.</p>
                <p>"What can you tell me about the Earth?" the Little Prince wondered.</p>
                <p>The geographer looked up from his work, his eyes twinkling with excitement. "Ah, the Earth! It is
                    a fascinating
                    planet. It is home to a vast array of landscapes and cultures. There are mountains that pierce
                    the clouds, oceans
                    that stretch as far as the eye can see, and forests teeming with life."</p>
                <p>The Little Prince listened intently, his imagination running wild. "What about the people? What
                    are they like?"</p>
                <p>The geographer sighed. "People are complex creatures. They build cities and create art. They have
                    dreams and
                    aspirations. But they also have their flaws. They can be kind and cruel, wise and foolish."</p>
                <p>The Little Prince pondered the geographer's words. He longed to see the Earth for himself, to
                    meet its inhabitants
                    and experience its wonders. With a newfound determination, he thanked the geographer and set his
                    sights on the blue
                    planet.</p>
                <p>"What can you tell me about the Earth?" the Little Prince wondered.</p>
                <p>The geographer looked up from his work, his eyes twinkling with excitement. "Ah, the Earth! It is
                    a fascinating planet. It is home to a vast array of landscapes and cultures. There are mountains
